# US-household-sql-analysis
Data analysis project using SQL on U.S. household income dataset. Covers cleaning, querying, and deriving insights into income levels and area distributions across states.

# 🏠 U.S. Household Income Data Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses SQL to analyze U.S. household income and geographic data. The goal is to clean the dataset, run analytical queries, and derive insights into income levels and land vs. water distributions across states.  

## 📂 Files in This Repository  
- **`us_household_cleaning.sql`** → Queries for data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling nulls, correcting invalid values).  
- **`us_household_analysis.sql`** → Queries for exploratory data analysis (income comparisons, land vs. water coverage, state-level metrics).  

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Techniques**: Data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, ordering, grouping, and case-based queries.  

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- Southern states tend to have lower household income compared to northern states.  
- Coastal states show higher percentages of water coverage than inland states.  
- States with larger land areas don’t always correlate with higher income levels.  

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
- Policymakers can use insights to identify regions needing economic support.  
- Businesses can target states with higher household income for market expansion.  
- Environmental factors (land vs. water ratio) should be considered when planning development.
